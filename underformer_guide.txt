The goal \nwas to get the community\u2019s \n\u201cfingerprints\u201d on the plan as it took shape, long \nbefore we went public. \nWith this in mind, we held a series of working \nsessions in winter and spring 2023 to draw \ninput from faculty, staff, parents, trustees, and \nalumni. And, of course, no constituency was \nmore important than our students. In order to \nensure that their words, phrases, and concepts \nhelped shape the vision, we asked participants \na series of questions, such as \u201cPicture a happy, \nthriving House community: What is the first \nword that comes to mind?\u201d Their responses \nformed a word cloud in which \u201cLove\u201d was most \nprominent, followed by \u201cSupport,\u201d \u201cFun,\u201d \nand \u201cFamily.\u201d The next largest words spoke to \n\u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cTrust,\u201d and then \u201cConnection,\u201d \n\u201cCaring,\u201d and \u201cCommunity.\u201d\nWhen we asked them what came to mind \nwhen they thought of \u201can engaging, supportive, \nchallenging Harkness classroom,\u201d the word \n\u201cCommunity\u201d emerged most notably in the \nword cloud, with \u201cCollaboration,\u201d \u201cRespect,\u201d \nand \u201cDebate\u201d drawing nearly as many responses, \nwith several others mentioned as\u00a0well.\nBuilding on this input, we asked respondents \nto develop their thinking a bit further. We \ninvited them to finish the sentence: \u201cThe House \nis a safe, supportive place for all students \nbecause\u2026\u201d Our students came back with \nthoughtfully reassuring answers: \u201c\u2026heads \nof houses are very involved and prefects are \npresent.\u201d  \u201c\u2026of my adviser.\u201d  \u201c\u2026all members of \nthe House prioritize the happiness and safety of \nothers.\u201d \u201c\u2026people care for each other.\u201d\nSimilarly, students offered their perspec\u00ad\ntive on the ideal Harkness environment by \ncompleting this sentence: \u201cThe Harkness \nclassroom supports intellectual growth and \nself-confidence because...\u201d Given the caliber \nof our students, we should not be surprised \nthat free flow of ideas was one aspect they \nparticularly valued: \u201c\u2026all voices are able to be \nheard.\u201d  \u201c\u2026it makes you think about something \nyou aren\u2019t comfortable thinking about.\u201d  \u201c\u2026sup\u00ad\nportive teachers who help facilitate two-sided \ndiscussions.\u201d \u201c\u2026people are not afraid to speak \nout.\u201d  \u201c\u2026people listen.\u201d  \u201c\u2026we challenge each \nother.\u201d  \u201c\u2026everyone has a voice.\u201d \u201c\u2026the diversity \nof perspectives and\u00a0opinions.\u201d \nBuilding on multiple input sessions across \nmany constituencies and involving questions \nabout many aspects of community wellbeing, \nwe hatched the Vision, which serves to paint the \npicture of where we are heading. Most import\u00ad\nant, we were able to incorporate language that \ndemonstrates particularly what our students \nvalue most about Lawrenceville as well as their \naspirations for an even stronger future as the \nfollowing excerpts show so powerfully: \nOverall wellbeing is enhanced when students feel \nsafe, supported, and empowered in an environ\u00ad\nment that promotes kindness, respect, joy, and a \nmeasured pace of life.\nLawrenceville\u2019s House system, vital to a sense of \nbelonging at the School, is strengthened when \nHouse culture, spirit, and values are purpose\u00ad\nfully developed \u2026 and when every student helps \nmake the House a fundamentally friendly and \nwelcoming community.\nEssential to Harkness teaching is the democracy \nof voices engaged around a table, where no voice \nis marginalized, and differing perspectives and \nindependent thinking are encouraged. \u2026 [And \nwhere] creativity, reflection, curiosity, and a \nlove of learning are universal aspects of the \nacademic experience.\nSo \u201cHouse, Harkness, Heart\u201d is launched with \na powerful vision for the future and a robust \nroadmap of initiatives to help us get there. \nPlease see the article on our strategic plan on \npage 10 in this issue of The Lawrentian, and stay \ntuned for additional updates as we measure our \nprogress going forward.  \nSincerely,\nCapturing Student Voices\nStephen S.

It was an anonymous survey \nenabling us to better understand what \ninterests you\u2006\u2014\u2006and what does not. Several \nquestions were open-ended, and they, along \nwith good quantitative data, yielded an \nabundance of very useful, helpful feedback. \nMany of you were rather complimentary, \nand I appreciate it. A good number of you \nwere also critical of the publication we produce, and I\u2019m just as grateful \nfor that. There were various times when I nodded in assent and thought, \n\u201cYes, I think we\u2019ve fallen short there, too.\u201d As I have written in this space \nbefore: This is your magazine, and I always want it to reflect Lawrenceville \nand its people. But you are an extraordinarily diverse group in many ways, \npeople whose primary experiences with this School may be separated by \n80 years or more, so that reflection of Lawrenceville takes on many forms \nand shapes and ideas. I think that\u2019s something to celebrate, because it\u2019s \nthe proof of a vibrant, animated community of Lawrentians that keeps \nlearning from its own people. We all have something to show to each \nother, and I hope this magazine is a place to illustrate that. \nSo, what you\u2019re looking at is the first issue of a refocused Lawrentian, \nwhich manifests the information we gleaned from the survey, as well as \non campus through smaller discovery groups, in collaboration with \na carefully selected creative partner who helped us reexamine our \napproach. We\u00a0put everything under the microscope. \nOne thing learned through all of this inquiry was that we were already \ndoing a lot of things right, and for that reason, you\u2019ll recognize much \nof what you see inside these pages. But you\u2019ll also notice our new look, \nupdated typefaces, reconsidered editorial departments, and a greater \nvariety of voices from our campus and beyond. We have also rolled out \na complementary digital platform that will give you the option to read, \nengage with, and share items from The Lawrentian on your desktop, \nlaptop, tablet, or phone.\nRight away, you\u2019ll take a more intimate and personal look inside the \nSchool, hear more from students, learn more about what\u2019s happening \nin the classroom, and have an opportunity to share your opinions on a \nparticular subject through \u201cThe Big Question.\u201d (You\u2019ll see the prompt \nafter page 80.)\nFinally: Class Notes isn\u2019t going anywhere. We know you love the section. \nBut you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re now calling it \u201cLawrentians\u201d to underscore the \nidea that this magazine is always about you. \nAll the best, \nSean Ramsden\nEditor\nsramsden@lawrenceville.org\nF R O M  T H E  B A S E M E N T  of P O P  H A L L\nEDITOR\nSean Ramsden\nDESIGN\nLandesberg Design\nNEWS EDITOR\nLisa M.

It\u2019s \nmore common than childhood asthma in America, and yet \nwe still don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Martoma explained. \u201cI had to \nnavigate this process entirely by myself, because there were \nno resources out there to guide me. I needed to change that.\u201d\nNow, Martoma and her brothers have been recognized \nfor their good work with $15,000 in seed funding as \na\u00a0grand-prize winner in the 2023 Changemaker Challenge. \nThe competition, sponsored by T-Mobile, the T-Mobile \nFoundation, and Ashoka, seeks initiatives driving positive \nchange.

Seeking to donate them, \nshe was initially refused by prison officials, who insisted that \ndonations must come from a nonprofit organization. \n\u201cSo, we formed a nonprofit,\u201d said Martoma, who added \nthat through November 2023, KidsMates had expanded its \nbook project to reach 23 out of 36 states in the United States \nwith federal prisons.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted prison visiting \narrangements, KidsMates redirected its efforts toward state \nand national legislative and advocacy work. Its endeavors \ncontributed to the adoption of the Martha Wright-Reid \nJust and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022, which \nrequires the Federal Communications Commission to ensure \nreasonable charges for inmates\u2019 electronic communications \nwith individuals outside the institution.

But it was as \nthough you just passed through this window. This has been an especially \ngood place to work \u2026 because short of being an associate professor at \nAmherst or Williams, I would not get to teach such able students.

And so now, as \nit turns out, I\u2019m a published poet, and I\u2019ve been nominated \ntwice for Pushcart Prizes.

Often, tours \ninvolve living history and exposure to local customs hidden \nfrom life in the United States. In Norway, he focuses on the \nculture of the S\u00e1mi, nomadic reindeer herders who have \noccupied these northern reaches for thousands of years. \nTutein\u2019s knowledge of places is earned firsthand through his \nown insatiable curiosity and desire to know people. On his \nfirst visit to a new locale, he\u2019ll drive himself around, \u201cbecause \nit\u2019s the best way you can see it. You can stop when you want to \nstop. I\u2019ll learn from somebody local.\u201d\nFor example, he recalls searching for surf spots along \nthe coast of western Bali. Approximately halfway across \nthe island (and after a bit of planning), Tutein came across \nan ancient festival known as Makepung\u2009\u2014\u2009a cultural tra\u00ad\ndition meaning \u201crace to the finish line,\u201d but while driving \nwater\u00a0buffalos. \n\u201cThey run around this little muddy dirt track, racing in a \nlittle wooden cart,\u201d he explains. \u201cI had spoken to one of the \nlocals, and I got to race.

He\u2019s also been swimming with orcas in the far \nnorthern reaches of Norway.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the Arctic Circle, so just the journey there is \narduous,\u201d Tutein says, explaining how a series of flights and \nferries takes you to a remote peninsula. He has come to the \nonly place in the world where you can legally free-dive with \norcas, and so with only about four hours of twilight per day \nin winter, Tutein and the crew run around in inflatable Zodiac \nboats before they jump into the icy water. It\u2019s clear enough \nto see an orca swimming fifty yards away, and he says his first \nencounter was likely his favorite. \n\u201cI was in the water before anyone and swam about twenty \nyards from the Zodiac, alone, and these two females, proba\u00ad\nbly each about 18 to 20 feet long, one on the right of me, one \non the left, were facing me,\u201d Tutein says. \u201cThey just hovered \nthere, about 10 or 15 feet away from me, staring. I could just \nhear my heartbeat, and then I calmed down, but wondered: \nWhat are they going to do?\u201d\nOne of the orcas soon departed, but the other curiously \nfollowed Tutein around the depths for some twenty minutes. \nOnce they returned to the boat, the orca began \u201cskyhop\u00ad\nping\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009sticking her head above the water to see her new \nfriends on board. \n\u201cShe put her tail up, and started putting on a performance \nfor us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d\nTutein is no stranger to the extraordinary.

But don\u2019t get rid of it the minute that Black \nand\u00a0Latino people become members.\u201d\nIndeed, at the time when my children were initially \ndenied admission to Lawrenceville\u2009\u2014\u2009one was waitlisted \nand eventually admitted later in the year; the other had to \napply a second time before being accepted\u2009\u2014\u2009I couldn\u2019t help \nthinking that legacy admissions had benefited white folks \nsince time immemorial, but the drawbridge was being raised \njust as my tribe approached the ivory tower. On the other \nhand, I instinctively resist the idea of rewarding even a ration \nof social advantage and educational privilege with more \nadvantage and privilege.\nAs it turns out, although Lawrenceville does recognize \nlegacy, the privilege afforded those students may be less \nthan you may imagine. \u201cWe are past the point where you can \njust sail in as a legacy,\u201d says Kyla Kupferstein Torres, a Black \neducational consultant whose roles over the past 20 years \nhave included being a director of admissions at both the \nOliver Program and the Hunter College High School. \u201cThose \ndays have been over for some time.\u201d  \nGreg Buckles, the Shelby M.C. Davis \u201954 Dean of \nEnrollment Management at Lawrenceville, puts a finer \npoint on it. \u201cWe still put a thumb on the scale for legacies, \nbut they have to be fully qualified,\u201d he says. Buckles went \non to describe a rating system that the admissions readers \nuse during the decision-making process at Lawrenceville: \nOut of a possible total of 25, academics can count for up to \n10 points; testing, 5 points; 5 points for personal qualities, \n28\u2003 | \u2003\nS PR I NG  2024 \n THE LAWRENTIAN\n""which includes an observation from an admis\u00ad\nsions interview; and a possible 5 points for \nextracurricular activities. The average score for \nlegacy admits is 17.5, which is the same for the \noverall number of students admitted. \nAccording to Buckles, legacy is not part \nof the formal admission criteria, but instead \none of 26 applicant categorizations that also \ninclude gender, race, form, athletics, boarding/\nday, children of faculty/staff, etc. This rubric is \nused to help ensure a balance across a range of \nstudent characteristics. In the end, the admit \nrate for legacy kids ranges between 45 to 50 \npercent, compared with anywhere from 15 to \n18\u00a0percent for the pool at large. \n\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Buckles explains, that \nlegacy applicants are competitive in their own \nright. Legacy kids are more than likely to come \nfrom \u201cfamilies who put a high value on educa\u00ad\ntion, are going to invest in education, and grew \nup with good reading habits, encouragement, \nand a range of cultural experiences.\u201d They are \n\u201con par with other admits, because the only \nthing tougher than not taking a legacy kid is \ntaking one that\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\nre-engineer Lawrenceville from a place where \nBlack bodies were tolerated to a place where \nBlack and Brown humanity could find belong\u00ad\ning.

And \nin subsequent years, my aunt and uncle inspired \na number of my cousins and friends to take a risk \non the boarding experience at Lawrenceville \nas\u00a0well. \nMy aunt and uncle laid fertile ground for me \nto become, among other things, the first Black \nstudent body president. But more important, \nsoon after I graduated, I worked with Earl \nWilson \u201977 and Ralph Spooner \u201975, and the dean \nof students at the time, Marty Doggett H\u201976 \n\u201982 \u201986 \u201987 \u201988 \u201992 \u201998 P\u201900, to orient incoming \nBlack students. Throughout the 1980s and \u201990s \nI co-organized the first Black alumni reunion, \nco-founded the predecessor to Lawrenceville\u2019s \nI couldn\u2019t help thinking \nthat legacy admissions \nhad benefited white folks \nsince time immemorial, \nbut the drawbridge was \nbeing raised just as my \ntribe approached the ivory \ntower.

I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life \nworking among low- and moderate-income \nBlack folks in Central Brooklyn. I come from \na family of New York City public school educators, and as a \ncommunity organizer and journalist I\u2019ve focused a big part \nof my career on supporting public schools. So even though \nI attended Lawrenceville myself, sending my children to \na New Jersey private school seemed to be a betrayal of my \nsocial justice values and my commitment to the Central \nBrooklyn\u00a0community.\nBut children\u2009\u2014\u2009and for many, the often-stark limitations \nof a public-school education for Black children in New York \nCity\u2009\u2014\u2009have a way of bending our politics and expectations. \nAnd by the time my kids left primary school, I began to view \nLawrenceville as not simply a school, but a special commu\u00ad\nnity, an ecosystem of supportive relationships and values \nwhere my children could flourish. \nIn fact, I was aware of these relationships and values \nbecause my family helped cultivate them.  \nMy uncle Max, a veritable institution at Lawrenceville, \nhas spent more than fifty years of his life attempting to \nthelawrentian.lawrenceville.org    | \u2003 29\n""current Black Alumni affinity group, spoke before numerous \nclassroom, School and alumni assemblies, and served on \nLawrenceville\u2019s executive alumni committee. I was explicitly \nseeking to create a place where future generations of Black \nstudents could thrive, but subconsciously I was seeking a \nschool I could entrust with my unborn children. \nWhile at the Oliver Program, Kupferstein Torres was \npart of an apparatus that helped prepare Black, Brown and \nlow- and moderate-income families to attend indepen\u00ad\ndent schools like Lawrenceville. She acknowledged the \nobvious\u2009\u2014\u2009that admitting the children of alumni is a way \nof developing self-interested donors\u2009\u2014\u2009but also noted that \nschools represent a \u201cgreater community.\u201d\n\u201cLawrenceville is not just students who attend now,\u201d \nshe\u00a0says, \u201cbut students who attended in the past, people who \nbecome parents, people who become grandparents.\u201d Legacy \nadmits have been historically important because schools \nwant to \u201cflag an existing connection to the institution,\u201d \nand legacy students become opportunities for schools \nto demonstrate \u201can awareness that they have about their \nsurroundings and who is in their application pool.\u201d\nThe question of legacy admission, and whether Black and \nBrown applicants are able to take advantage of it, speaks \ndirectly to the question of who gets chosen to be a living \nand active part of a school\u2019s history and narrative. Heather \nFlewelling, a Black woman who attended St. Paul\u2019s School in \nNew Hampshire and for nineteen years counseled students \nat Milton Academy and helped Milton tackle institutional \ndiversity questions, observed, \u201cThere are different vibes at \ndifferent schools, and it takes a while to pass that culture \nalong. And so, having some applicants and some students \ncoming in that have heard a narrative, beyond their day-one, \nof those values and those traditions, helps the institution \nmaintain some of that narrative.\u201d Legacy kids, Flewelling \npoints out, are the \u201ccultural translators for their peers\u201d who \ncan tell the story of what the school \u201conce was and, hope\u00ad\nfully, how far it has come. Sometimes you need the narrative \nto carry backwards and say, yes you can, you can do this. \nAnd we are here and we\u2019ve been here. And upon my shoul\u00ad\nders you\u00a0may stand.\u201d \nTHE COLOR OF EQUITY\nL\nawrenceville is the perfect proving ground \nfor issues such as race-conscious admissions, \npreferences given to athletes, and legacy. Unlike \ncolleges and universities that accept federal \ndollars, Lawrenceville, and independent schools \nlike it, are not subject to federal rulings. \u201cWe believe strongly \nin any independent school\u2019s right to self-determination,\u201d \nBuckles asserts.  \nBut without any external pressures or formal guardrails \nfor public accountability, this \u201cself-determination\u201d \nonly increases the stakes for Lawrenceville to be more \nthoughtful in how it shapes its community. Meanwhile, \ncalling the question of legacy forces us to confront some \ninconvenient\u00a0truths.\n\u201cIs it \u2018fair\u2019? It\u2019s useful, but of course it\u2019s not \u2018fair,\u2019\u201d \nKupferstein says. \u201cIt\u2019s insider trading, it\u2019s compound \ninterest. But an independent school is not a public school. \nIt\u00a0wasn\u2019t established to offer an \u2018equal\u2019 shot.\u201d \nFlewelling takes it a step further. \u201cAcademic institutions \nare inequitable walking in the door, because you can\u2019t just \nsay it\u2019s based solely on academic achievement. You can\u2019t \njust say you\u2019re going to take the smartest kids. How are you \ngoing to measure that?\u201d she says. \u201cHow do you control for \nthe educational, cultural, and environmental experiences \nthat kids may or may not have had? How are you going to \nmeasure capacity to grow, capacity to achieve, and capacity \nto impact?\u201d\nAt a time when the nation is so hopelessly divided into \nideological camps, nuanced conversations about identity \nand community-building are hard to come by. Flewelling \nwonders whether we are free to consider \u201cBIPOC [Black, \nIndigenous, and people of color] legacy when the national \ndiscourse around privilege and access seems to suggest that \nwe should get rid of\u201d legacy all together. \u201cWe want to break \ndown the institutional legacy of white and male supremacy \nAND we want to sustain a sense of who we were,\u201d she says. \n\u201cHow do you do both?\u201d\nPAYING FORWARD\nI\nmages from the morning of May 28, 2022, linger with \nme to this day.

Over the next \nhalf-century, her opulent 104-foot \nwooden yacht would play both elegant host and silent \nwitness to some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant \nmoments of international strategic planning and diplomacy, \nas well as the notable celebrations and heartbreaks of the \nten U.S. presidents who found a comfortable retreat aboard \nSequoia\u2009\u2014\u2009the floating White House. \nToday, the 99-year-old Sequoia sits in Cambridge, \nMaryland, on the state\u2019s Eastern Shore at the Richardson \nMaritime Museum, awaiting a long-overdue restoration. \nMichael Cantor \u201979, managing partner of Equator Capital \nGroup, the private-equity firm that owns Sequoia, has \nundertaken the job of restoring the craft to its 1930s \ngrandeur, echoing a time when Franklin D. Roosevelt GP\u201957 \ncruised thirty-nine times aboard the craft. For Cantor, the \nproject allows his interest in the past and enthusiasm for \nwooden yachts to dovetail in a meaningful way. \n\u201cI did grow up around water, and with boats. And I worked \nat construction during my summers at Lawrenceville back \nin Kentucky, doing carpentry,\u201d he says. \u201cI never had a nice \nwood boat, though. \n\u201cBut \u2026 this was an accident,\u201d he says of taking on the \nSequoia project. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to do this.\u201d\nCantor and Equator Capital were awarded ownership \nof Sequoia by a Delaware court in 2016 for a price officially \nrecorded as \u201czero dollars,\u201d but only after Equator, as mort\u00ad\ngage holder, had paid out some $7 million to the previous \nowner, and in attorneys\u2019 costs. \n\u201cAfter loaning him enough to pay off his previous mort\u00ad\ngage, we had to pay to maintain the boat, pay his insurance \nmaintenance and everything that he wasn\u2019t doing, and then \nwe had to pay all these legal fees,\u201d Cantor says. \u201cAnd the \nfrustrating part was that none of that went to help Sequoia.\u201d\nThe yacht\u2019s condition would have appalled any of the \ncommanders-in-chief who used it for state business, from \nHerbert Hoover GP\u201958 \u201959 to Gerald Ford. It was, according \nto the chancery judge, Sam Glasscock III, \u201can elderly and \nvulnerable wooden yacht \u2026 sitting on an inadequate cradle \non an undersized marine railway in a moribund boatyard \non the western shore of the Chesapeake, deteriorating and, \nlately, home to raccoons.\u201d\nLast October, after four mostly idle years in Belfast, \nMaine, Sequoia was transported back to Cambridge, where \nthe restoration\u2009\u2014\u2009expected to take as long as five years, \nunder the work of up to twenty shipwrights\u2009\u2014\u2009could cost \n$10\u00a0million. \n  Michael Cantor \u201979 will \nsee Sequoia restored to its \n1930s grandeur.

The serial \ndesignation was dropped from its name, and Sequoia was \nused for two years as a decoy to lure bootleggers, who were \nfooled by the craft\u2019s lavish appearance, on the Chesapeake \nand Delaware bays, according to the yacht\u2019s longtime cap\u00ad\ntain, Giles M. Kelly, in his book, Sequoia: Presidential Yacht. \nHoover, an admirer of Mathis-Trumpy yachts, also began \nusing Sequoia in 1931. He grew so fond of the craft that \nits photo graced the 1932 White House Christmas card. \nThough he was criticized for showcasing such opulence \nwhile Americans were enduring unprecedented economic \nhardship, Hoover\u2019s use of Sequoia for both official and \npersonal use marked the beginning of the long and integral \nrelationship between the yacht and the presidency. \nThree months after the United States detonated atomic \nbombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, \nPresident Harry S. Truman hosted Prime Ministers Clement \nAttlee of Great Britain and William Lyon Mackenzie King of \nCanada on a cruise past Mount Vernon to discuss the control \nof such weapons. The next year, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower \nand British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery concep\u00ad\ntualized what would become NATO aboard the yacht. During \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, President John F. Kennedy \nheld secret talks on Sequoia; seven months later, he cele\u00ad\nbrated his 46th and final birthday on board. Richard M. Nixon \nreached his decision to resign the presidency in 1974 while \naboard Sequoia, wistfully rendering \u201cGod Bless America\u201d on \nthe yacht\u2019s piano in the aftermath of his choice. Designated \nas a National Historic Landmark in 1987, Sequoia had passed \nthrough a series of private ownerships after being sold by \nPresident Jimmy Carter in 1977. Cantor took ownership in \n2016 and possession in 2019 following litigation with the \nVirginia shipyard that had damaged Sequoia\u2019s hull. \nS\nequoia was designed by John Trumpy and \nconstructed by the Mathis Yacht Building \nCo. of Camden, New Jersey, in 1925 for Emily \nRoebling Cadwalader and her husband, \nPhiladelphia banker Richard M. Cadwalader, \nwho paid $200,000\u2009\u2014\u2009the equivalent of $3.5 \nmillion today. Built of longleaf yellow pine, \nwhite oak, mahogany, and teak, the yacht was launched that \nOctober as the Sequoia II, replacing the 85-foot Sequoia the \nCadwaladers had purchased just one year earlier. The new \nwooden craft was used by the couple for several elegant \ncruises off Miami and West Palm Beach, Florida, which were \nnoted in the local society pages; in the summer, they cruised \nthe Delaware and Chesapeake bays. \nSeeking to impress Richard\u2019s fellow members in the New \nYork Yacht Club, Emily Cadwalader\u2019s attention again began \nto stray toward a larger vessel, and so the Sequoia II was sold \nto Houston oil magnate William Dunning in 1928.

The intervening \npandemic and various technical issues sidelined the project for four \nyears before Sequoia returned to Cambridge, Maryland, where the \nwork will take place, in late 2023.\n\u200c\u201cH\nave you ever heard of Theseus\u2019 \nparadox?\u201d Cantor asks. It\u2019s a \nphilosophy exercise that raises the \nquestion of whether an object\u2009\u2014\u2009say, \na wooden yacht badly in need of \nrestoration\u2009\u2014\u2009that has had all of its \ncomponents replaced is fundamen\u00ad\ntally the same object. \n\u201cIn Maine, they express it in a \ndifferent way,\u201d Cantor explains. \u201cThey \nsay, \u2018This is my grandfather\u2019s axe. He loved this axe. He put \ntwo new heads and three new shafts on it.\u2019 And then you \nthink to yourself, Well then, is that really his axe?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a question Cantor has found himself considering as he \nsearches for the wood to replace Sequoia\u2019s hull. The planking \non the outside of the hull was originally longleaf yellow \npine and the framing, white oak. Cantor is insistent these \nelements be used in the restoration, but not just any longleaf \nyellow pine or oak will do. \n\u201cThere were 90 million acres of old-growth, longleaf yel\u00ad\nlow pine in the southeast when Columbus landed; now there \nare around 9,000 acres,\u201d he explains of the endangered \nspecies. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a conservationist, so even if someone will \nlet me, I\u2019m not going to go cut down a 400-year-old tree and \nuse it for this.\u201d\n36\u2003 | \u2003\nS PR I NG  2024 \n THE LAWRENTIAN\n""\u201c\u0007I\u2019m a conservationist, so even if \nsomeone will let me, I\u2019m not going to \ngo cut down a 400-year-old tree and \nuse it for this.\u201d\nCantor recalls a conversation with Todd French of \nFrench & Webb, the Belfast, Maine-based firm tapped \nto do the restoration, about procuring wood for the job. \nExplaining his requirements, Cantor said, \u201cWe have to find \nold-growth white oak and longleaf yellow pine that has \nfallen naturally and shares the presidential history,\u2019\u201d he \nrecalls. By \u201cpresidential history,\u201d Cantor means sourcing \nwood from properties with direct links to the U.S. presidents \nwho have cruised aboard Sequoia\u2009\u2014\u2009a task taller than even \nthe trees\u00a0themselves. \n\u201cAnd Todd\u2019s like, \u2018Are you effing crazy?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut \nwe\u00a0did, at least for all the longleaf yellow pine.\u201d\n Adding degrees of difficulty to their search is that if a \ntree is snapped by strong winds, the breakage weakens the \nstructural integrity of the wood, rendering it unusable. \nFor Cantor\u2019s purposes, he is seeking timber from trees that \ntoppled at the roots due to the destabilizing combination of \nheavy rains and high winds. Keeping his ear to the ground, \nhe tapped into what he calls a fanatical subculture of people \nwho deal in wood for historic yachts. \n\u201cAnd one of them told me about this plantation in \nGeorgia where Hurricanes Irma and Michael had knocked \ndown 150 old-growth trees,\u201d he says. The property, \nCantor explains, was formerly owned by John Hay \u201cJock\u201d \nWhitney, Eisenhower\u2019s ambassador to the Court of St. \nJames\u2019s. Whitney was the second husband of Betsy Cushing \nRoosevelt Whitney, who had been married in the 1930s to \nJames Roosevelt II, son of the president. The link to F.D.R. \nwas already in place, but Cantor found something that \nstrengthened it\u2009\u2014\u2009old film, donated to the Roosevelt Library \nin 2018, that once belonged to Marguerite \u201cMissy\u201d LeHand, \nthe president\u2019s longtime private secretary, depicting Betsy \nCushing Roosevelt and the president aboard Sequoia during \nher marriage to James. \nThe longleaf yellow pine to be used comes from this \nland, says Cantor, who is also gratified that the wood will \nhave strong bipartisan credentials. He underscores the \nconnection to Roosevelt, a Democrat, but adds that Jock \nWhitney and public relations practitioner \u201cTex\u201d McCrary \nwere the forces behind the famous 1952 rally at Madison \nSquare Garden to persuade a skeptical Eisenhower to run \nfor president as a Republican. Eisenhower, who would suffer \na heart attack during his first term, \u201csupposedly made the \ndecision [to run for reelection] while bird hunting on this \nplantation,\u201d\u00a0Cantor says. \nEven the nation\u2019s most esteemed independent\u2009\u2014\u2009George \nWashington\u2009\u2014\u2009will be represented in the restoration of \nSequoia, whose link to the first president\u2019s Mount Vernon \nestate is strong, according to Cantor. \n\u201cIn 2019, I read that the last white oak personally planted \nby Washington fell,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, I need white oak, and I \ncalled the arborist and he said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t have it.\u2019\u201d But \nafter negotiation, Mount Vernon generously donated the \nwood to the Sequoia project with a ceremony befitting \nthe\u00a0occasion.\nThroughout its history, Sequoia was changed and adapted \nfor the times and the users. Roosevelt\u2019s elevator was con\u00ad\nverted into a bar by Lyndon Johnson, for example, all of which \nposes another question for Cantor: To which moment in time \nshould Sequoia be restored? \n\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to keep the bar, but try to pick a \nperiod during Roosevelt,\u201d he says, adding that the 1960s \nsaw such modifications as air-conditioning units punched \nthrough the mahogany walls. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick a point when it was \nstill a beautiful, classic yacht, before it got added onto.\u201d\nWhen the restoration is complete, Cantor will oversee \nan artifact of U.S. history that was the envy of even the \nnation\u2019s global adversaries\u2009\u2014\u2009some of whom later became \nfriends. When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev visited \nWashington, D.C., in 2001, he was photographed with his \ndaughter, Irina Virganskaya, and then-captain Tony Wells \naboard Sequoia. \u201cWhen \u2018Gorby\u2019 came up to the wheelhouse,\u201d \nWells told a reporter, \u201che grasped the steering wheel and \ndeclared, \u2018Now, at last, I am in charge of America\u2019s Ship \nof\u00a0State.\u2019\u201d\nGiven its historical significance, it\u2019s appropriate that the \nfully restored Sequoia will not only be used by Cantor but \nalso function as an educational platform for the public.\n\u201cShe will cruise locally and along the East Coast,\u201d Cantor \nsays, \u201cas a floating venue to teach American presidential \nhistory and to promote conservation and ocean conserva\u00ad\ntion causes.\u201d \nthelawrentian.lawrenceville.org    | \u2003 37\n""I N S I D E  T H E  G A T E S\nA S K  T H E  A R C H I V I S T\nA Curtain \nRises\nFor generations, Lawrenceville \nstruggled to keep pace with the \ngrowing student need for a suitable \nperforming and visual arts space. \nThen came the Kirby Arts Center. \nBY Jacqueline Haun \n  The Kirby Arts Center \nauditorium looks much today as \nit did in 1963. Note the orchestra \npit, typically covered today to \nextend the stage.\nA\nlthough the Allan P. Kirby Arts Center cele\u00ad\nbrated its 60th anniversary in 2023, its roots \nactually go back a full century, to November \n1923. That month, the possibility of a new \nauditorium was first mentioned in the pages \nof The Lawrence in a description of plans for \nwhat would, two years later, become the Fathers Building. \nCharacterized at the time as \u201cthe most important part of \nthe building\u201d and slated to cost $90,000 (the equivalent of \n$1.58 million today), the new space would hold 800 people \nand be equipped with a large stage. But the new \u201cPop Hall,\u201d \ndesigned by architect William Adams Delano, Class of 1891, \nwas built without the auditorium. It would take another 40 \nyears before that goal was accomplished.\nAs the School grew over the years, it became increasingly \nobvious that there was no longer a space large enough to \naccommodate the entire school community. When Woods \nMemorial Hall was built in 1885, an auditorium was included \non the second floor in the space that is now the Heely Room. \nHowever, a room built to accommodate a school of 112 \nstudents and ten faculty was strained by the 500-plus stu\u00ad\ndents who constituted the student body by the early 1920s. \nAnd although Edith Memorial Chapel could hold up to 682 \npeople in its pews, the routine secular use of of designated \nreligious space was deemed inappropriate.\n78\u2003 | \u2003\nSPR I NG  2024 \n THE LAWRENTIAN\n""Also complicating things was the increase in art and \ntheater programming on campus. The small stage \nperformances of the Gilded Age had grown to be three full-\nscale productions by the Periwig Club each year, with \nsignificant casts and large tech crews. Periwig continued to \nperform for a while on the small temporary stage of Memorial \nHall, but by 1936, the School arranged to use the new \nMcCarter Theater in Princeton for productions. Meanwhile, \nan Art Department had been created on campus in 1934, \nalthough they functioned in a series of makeshift studios in \nvarious locations across campus. \nAn unwieldy situation became suddenly untenable in \n1960. Periwig, which by now numbered 200 students, lost its \n\u201chome base\u201d when the 1902 \u201cOld Gym\u201d burned to the ground \nover winter break in 1959, and McCarter Theater informed the \nSchool that it would no longer accommodate the School\u2019s \nimmensely popular spring shows due to other performance \ncommitments. Fortunately, relief arrived in the form of the \ncapital campaign associated with Lawrenceville\u2019s sesquicen\u00ad\ntennial celebration. With the construction of Lavino Field \nHouse complete, a dedicated auditorium building became \nthe next goal. Trustee Allan P. Kirby, Class of 1913, declared \nhis willingness to fund the project in the hopes that a new \narts building would \u201cdo for the arts what the field house has \ndone for athletics\u201d at Lawrenceville.\nThe curtain rose on the Kirby Arts Center, designed by \nLivingston Smith and Walter F. Thaete of the Smith and \nThaete architectural firm of Philadelphia, on March 9, 1963, \nwith afternoon musical performances by the School band \nand choral groups, featuring music by noted composer \nRandall Thompson, Class of 1916. Also christening the \nstage was a guest choral group of girls from the Baldwin \nSchool. That evening, the Periwig Club performed their \nfirst spring show in the new space, Teahouse of the August \nMoon. But the new, increased capacity allowed for more \nthan just performances: That same month, Lawrenceville \nhosted a combined meeting of New Jersey Secondary School \nAssociation and the New Jersey Association of Independent \nSchools, bringing together public and private schools to \ndiscuss innovative pedagogy and demonstrating use of the \nHarkness method. Graduates who had bemoaned the lack \nof adequate space as students were introduced to the new \nbuilding when it was dedicated that May during the annual \nAlumni Day\u00a0celebration.\nThe gleaming new building featured auditorium seating \nfor 890, a professional-level staging area and workshop, \nand dressing areas that included locker rooms and show\u00ad\ners. Along the right-hand side of the building was an art \ngallery\u2009\u2014\u2009now a dance studio\u2009\u2014\u2009and an art studio in what \nis today Studio I. The lower level of the building also had a \nrabbit warren of spaces for various extracurricular activities, \nincluding offices for The Lawrence, the Olla Podrida, The Lit, \nand a photography studio for the Camera Club that included \ndeveloping and printing rooms. \nThe KAC has been periodically updated over the years, \nwith some seating transitioned to accessible spaces for users \nwith disabilities at the back of the theater, and many of the \nformer organizational offices converted to staff offices and \nstorage spaces. Most notably, the Art Department was moved \nin 1998 to the newly renovated Gruss Center of the Arts, \nwhich subsequently allowed the art areas to be remade into \ndance studios. Just as the visual arts continue to be well-sup\u00ad\nported in today\u2019s Gruss Center for Art and Design, the dance \nprogram now housed in the KAC has flourished, offering \nmultiple performances per year on the grand stage. \nAll of the community continues to meet in the KAC for \nthe weekly School Meeting as well as for special events and \nperformances. As Mr. Kirby hoped, the beautiful, functional \nvenue he supported in 1963 has helped make the arts at \nLawrenceville an integral part of campus life.\nJacqueline Haun is the senior archives librarian of \nthe\u00a0Stephan\u00a0Archives\u00a0in Bunn Library. \n  Peter Candler H\u201963 \u201967 \u201968 \u201976, director of theater from 1960-85, was a \nfamiliar figure in the lobby of the Kirby Arts Center, which remains very much \nunchanged from this 1960s scene. \n  A pre-1935 rendering of a proposed auditorium by the firm of Delano & \nAldrich, which designed the similarly styled Mackenzie Building and John \nDixon Library, now the home of the Hutchins Galleries and Hutchins Institute \nfor Social Justice. \nthelawrentian.lawrenceville.org    | \u2003 79\n""T H E  F I N A L  W O R D\nHouse Life Teaches \nLawrentians \nto Thrive\nHow the House system gives \nstudents the experiences and \ntools they need to grow and thrive \nphysically, emotionally, spiritually, \nand intellectually.\nBy Blake Eldridge \u201996 H\u201978 \u201912 P\u201925, Dean of Students\nH\nouse life has always worked to make sure \nstudents are prepared for thoughtful, informed \ndecision-making and readiness for post-\nLawrenceville independence. And we have \nalways adjusted to deal with the strengths and \nchallenges that characterize each generation of students.\nThe opportunity to live in a reflective community\u2009\u2014\u2009both \nHouse and campus\u2009\u2014\u2009with a range of personalities and \nperspectives has been Lawrenceville\u2019s true genius.\nAs a student in the Kennedy House, I remember the nego\u00ad\ntiations\u2009\u2014\u2009sometimes intense!\u2009\u2014\u2009about what we were going to \nwatch as a House on the one TV and the rickety VCR. While it \nseemed trivial at the time, in retrospect, I realize that those \nexperiences were the training for the everyday advocacies \nand concessions that characterize community life. \nOccasionally, we would be pleasantly surprised by the \nshow or movie that we initially rejected. But more impor\u00ad\ntantly, the sharing of time together (and the commentary \nthat recalled Mystery Science Theater 3000) brought us \ntogether in ways that structured, mediated interactions \nsimply cannot. Our wellbeing developed as we learned \nto\u00a0manage situations that were not our initial preference, \nbut\u00a0we found the good and fellowship in them.\nAs a head of the mighty Dickinson House, I saw similar \nmoments, especially around the planning and preparation \nfor House social events. I knew that House social events are \nan interesting phenomenon\u2009\u2014\u2009unique in that the success of \nthe event is directly proportional to the students\u2019 planning \nand effort. The students, however, had to learn that lesson \nthemselves. There was never unanimity about what kind of \nevent to have or when to hold it. But once the calendar was \nset, the students needed to pull together, and they took \nconcrete steps for something only speculative at the time. \nStudents still come back to campus and talk about our \nWinter Formals or the Barefoot and Crazy Spring Beach \nBash that they hosted. And while the events themselves were \nephemeral, the feeling of being together and offering up \nsomething good for others remains. \nOur current students started to come of age during the \npandemic, and the confusing messages and tensions of that \nperiod informed their development. Their experiences at \nthat impressionable age were typically family-focused and \nself-directed but also included fears of resource scarcity, \nsocial isolation, overreliance on digital and social media, \nhaving academic grades and performance be the only \nmeasure their schools could make of them, and the potential \nviral dangers of public places. Consciously or not, these \nsame aspects now seem coded into the students\u2019 sense of \nthemselves and their experience of community.\nHouse life combats all of those pandemic challenges and \ncan help rewrite that code. And House life is most successful \nwhen students\u2019 eagerness for social interaction, their desire \nto explore different aspects of their identity, and their \nwillingness to balance their own desires with respect for \nothers\u2019 needs all complement each other in a supportive \nenvironment. That combination for House life sounds a lot \nlike the recipe for personal wellbeing. So, the messages, dis\u00ad\ncussions, and experiences in the Houses, coupled with the \ngeneral atmosphere of kindness and dignity, can continue \nto do the essential work of creating individuals prepared for \nthoughtful, informed decision-making and readiness for \npost-Lawrenceville independence. \nThese days, there may be fewer nights when the whole \nHouse gathers around one TV to watch a worn-out VHS tape, \nbut Houses still put on fantastic events for the community \nand continue to imagine and deliver on new ways to be \ntogether, growing more comfortable with who we are.\nAs dean of students, Blake Eldridge \u201996 H\u201978 \u201912 P\u201925 is part of the \nWellness Team that will shepherd the School\u2019s new strategic plan, \nHouse, Harkness, Heart: A New Era for Community Wellbeing.
